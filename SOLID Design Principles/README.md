### :boom: S.O.L.I.D Introduction:   
SOLID is an acronym for the five important object oriented design principles in OOP.  
These principles, when combined together make it easy for programmer to develop software that are **easy to maintain,understand and extend.** They also make it easy for developers to **avoid code smells, easy to refector code, and also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.**  

**S.O.L.I.D stands for:**    
 * S  : **Single Responsibility Principle**       
 * O  : **Open closed Principle**   
 * L  : **Liskov substitution Principle**     
 * I  : **Interface Segregation Principle**     
 * D  : **Dependency Inversion Principle**      
 
 **If we don’t follow SOLID Principles we**  
 * End up with tight or strong coupling of the code with many other modules/applications.  
 * Tight coupling causes time to implement any new requirement, features or any bug fixes and some times it creates unknown issues.  
 * End up with a code which is not testable.  
 * End up with duplication of code.  
 * End up creating new bugs by fixing another bug.  
 * End up with many unknown issues in the application development cycle.  
 * When developers design without using structured design principles like SOLID, they can create long-lasting problems for future developers working on the project, and limit potential success for the application they’re developing. These issues are commonly referred to as **“code rot.”**  

**Following SOLID Principles helps us to**  
* Achieve reduction in complexity of code.  
* Increase readability, extensibility and maintenance.  
* Reduce error and implement Reusability.  
* Achieve Better testability.  
* Reduce tight coupling.  

**Solution to develop a successful application depends on** 
* Architecture : choosing an architecture is the first step in designing application based on the requirements. Example : MVC, WEBAPI, MVVM..etc.  
* Design Principles : Application development process need to follow the design principles.  
* Design Patterns : We need to choose correct design patterns to build the software.
